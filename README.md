# Titanic Dataset - Data Preprocessing & EDA (GUVI-HCL Hackathon)

## 📌 Objective
This project aims to perform data cleaning, preprocessing, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to identify patterns and trends that impact survival.

## 📁 Files Included
- `Titanic_EDA_Hackathon.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with preprocessing and analysis
- `titanic.csv`: Dataset used for the analysis

## 📊 Steps Covered
1. Data Cleaning:
   - Missing values handled for `Age` and `Embarked`
   - Dropped `Cabin` column due to excess missing data
2. Feature Engineering:
   - Label encoding for categorical features (`Sex`, `Embarked`)
   - Normalization of numerical values (`Age`, `Fare`)
3. Exploratory Data Analysis:
   - Visualizations using seaborn & matplotlib
   - Survival analysis by gender, age distribution, and heatmap of correlations

## 🛠️ Requirements
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Open `Titanic_EDA_Hackathon.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab
3. Run all cells to view the analysis and output

## ✅ Submission Details
This submission is created as part of **Review 1 – Data Preprocessing & EDA** for the **GUVI-HCL Hackathon**.
